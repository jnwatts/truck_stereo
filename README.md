# truck_stereo
A very simple ESP32+RN52 stereo module for an old truck

I really want to make a much nicer "head unit", but as I can't seem to keep focused on that much larger project I figured I would throw this together with minimal effort for my minimal effort truck.

If you find something here useful, great! Just make sure you attribute me somewhere in your software & source. :-)
